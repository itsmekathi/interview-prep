C# and the .NET Core framework come with built-in support and implementations of several commonly used design patterns, which help developers create robust, reusable, and maintainable code. Here's a summary of some of these patterns:

---

### **1. Singleton Pattern**

Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

**Built-In Support in .NET Core:**

- The `AddSingleton` method in ASP.NET Core's Dependency Injection (DI) framework:
  ```csharp
  services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();
  ```
  - Ensures the same instance of `MyService` is used throughout the application.

**Use Case:**

- Logging, configuration management, or caching where only one instance is needed globally.

---

### **2. Factory Pattern**

Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

**Built-In Support in .NET Core:**

- `IServiceProvider` and the DI framework allow factories to resolve dependencies dynamically:
  ```csharp
  services.AddTransient<IMyService>(provider => new MyService("param"));
  ```
- The `Task.Factory` class is an example of a factory for creating tasks:
  ```csharp
  Task task = Task.Factory.StartNew(() => Console.WriteLine("Task running"));
  ```

**Use Case:**

- Creating objects dynamically based on runtime conditions.

---

### **3. Builder Pattern**

Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

**Built-In Support in .NET Core:**

- `StringBuilder`:
  ```csharp
  var builder = new StringBuilder();
  builder.Append("Hello ").Append("World!");
  string result = builder.ToString();
  ```
- `ConfigurationBuilder` in ASP.NET Core:
  ```csharp
  var configuration = new ConfigurationBuilder()
      .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
      .Build();
  ```

**Use Case:**

- Building complex objects like query strings, JSON objects, or configuration settings.

---

### **4. Adapter Pattern**

Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper that translates calls from one interface to another.

**Built-In Support in .NET Core:**

- `Stream` classes, such as `StreamReader` and `StreamWriter`, act as adapters between a stream and its textual representation.
- Example of wrapping:
  ```csharp
  var fileStream = new FileStream("file.txt", FileMode.Open);
  var reader = new StreamReader(fileStream);
  ```

**Use Case:**

- Integrating third-party libraries or legacy systems.

---

### **5. Decorator Pattern**

Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically without modifying its structure.

**Built-In Support in .NET Core:**

- Middleware in ASP.NET Core is a practical example:
  ```csharp
  app.Use(async (context, next) =>
  {
      // Pre-processing
      await next.Invoke();
      // Post-processing
  });
  ```
- Streams in .NET also use this pattern:
  ```csharp
  var gzipStream = new GZipStream(new FileStream("file.txt", FileMode.Open), CompressionMode.Compress);
  ```

**Use Case:**

- Adding cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, or caching.

---

### **6. Observer Pattern**

Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

**Built-In Support in .NET Core:**

- `IObservable<T>` and `IObserver<T>` interfaces in the `System` namespace:
  ```csharp
  public class TemperatureMonitor : IObservable<float>
  {
      // Implementation
  }
  ```
- Event handlers and `event` keyword in C# are also based on this pattern:
  ```csharp
  public event EventHandler SomethingChanged;
  ```

**Use Case:**

- Implementing event-driven architectures, notifications, or real-time updates.

---

### **7. Strategy Pattern**

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

**Built-In Support in .NET Core:**

- DI allows easy swapping of implementations at runtime:
  ```csharp
  services.AddScoped<ICompressionStrategy, GzipCompression>();
  ```
- LINQ's `OrderBy` uses a strategy by allowing a custom comparison delegate:
  ```csharp
  var sortedList = myList.OrderBy(x => x.Name);
  ```

**Use Case:**

- Switching between different algorithms or business logic without modifying the client code.

---

### **8. Proxy Pattern**

Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

**Built-In Support in .NET Core:**

- `HttpClient` acts as a proxy for making HTTP requests.
- WCF's service proxies act as client-side stubs for remote services.

**Use Case:**

- Remote method invocation, lazy initialization, or logging access to resources.

---

### **9. Chain of Responsibility Pattern**

Passes a request along a chain of handlers until one handles it.

**Built-In Support in .NET Core:**

- ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline:
  ```csharp
  app.UseAuthentication();
  app.UseAuthorization();
  ```

**Use Case:**

- Building request-processing pipelines, such as in web applications or message handlers.

---

### **10. Dependency Injection (DI)**

A pattern for providing dependencies to classes rather than letting them instantiate dependencies themselves.

**Built-In Support in .NET Core:**

- ASP.NET Core has a built-in DI container:
  ```csharp
  services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();
  ```

**Use Case:**

- Promotes loose coupling and testability.

---

### **11. Template Method Pattern**

Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, letting subclasses override certain steps.

**Built-In Support in .NET Core:**

- Abstract classes with virtual/abstract methods:

  ```csharp
  public abstract class DataExporter
  {
      public void Export()
      {
          LoadData();
          FormatData();
          WriteData();
      }

      protected abstract void LoadData();
      protected abstract void FormatData();
      protected abstract void WriteData();
  }
  ```

**Use Case:**

- Implementing workflows with varying steps in subclasses.

These patterns demonstrate how the .NET Core framework encourages clean, maintainable, and extensible designs by embedding these principles directly into its APIs and architecture. Let me know if youâ€™d like a deeper dive into any specific pattern!
