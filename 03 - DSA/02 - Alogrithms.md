Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They are fundamental to programming and computer science, as they provide methods to perform calculations, data processing, and automated reasoning tasks. Below is an overview of different types of algorithms commonly used in programming, along with brief explanations and examples.

### 1. **Sorting Algorithms**

Sorting algorithms arrange the elements of a list or array in a specified order (usually ascending or descending). Common sorting algorithms include:

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

  **Example**:

  ```csharp
  void BubbleSort(int[] arr)
  {
      int n = arr.Length;
      for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
      {
          for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++)
          {
              if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1])
              {
                  // Swap arr[j] and arr[j + 1]
                  int temp = arr[j];
                  arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                  arr[j + 1] = temp;
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- **Quick Sort**: An efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array around it.

  **Example**:

  ```csharp
  int Partition(int[] arr, int low, int high)
  {
      int pivot = arr[high];
      int i = low - 1;
      for (int j = low; j < high; j++)
      {
          if (arr[j] < pivot)
          {
              i++;
              // Swap arr[i] and arr[j]
              int temp = arr[i];
              arr[i] = arr[j];
              arr[j] = temp;
          }
      }
      // Swap arr[i + 1] and arr[high] (or pivot)
      int temp1 = arr[i + 1];
      arr[i + 1] = arr[high];
      arr[high] = temp1;
      return i + 1;
  }

  void QuickSort(int[] arr, int low, int high)
  {
      if (low < high)
      {
          int pi = Partition(arr, low, high);
          QuickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
          QuickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
      }
  }
  ```

### 2. **Search Algorithms**

Search algorithms are used to find an element in a data structure. Common search algorithms include:

- **Linear Search**: A simple algorithm that checks each element in a list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends.

  **Example**:

  ```csharp
  int LinearSearch(int[] arr, int target)
  {
      for (int i = 0; i < arr.Length; i++)
      {
          if (arr[i] == target)
              return i; // Return the index of the found element
      }
      return -1; // Not found
  }
  ```

- **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

  **Example**:

  ```csharp
  int BinarySearch(int[] arr, int target)
  {
      int low = 0;
      int high = arr.Length - 1;

      while (low <= high)
      {
          int mid = (low + high) / 2;
          if (arr[mid] == target)
              return mid; // Element found
          else if (arr[mid] < target)
              low = mid + 1; // Search in the right half
          else
              high = mid - 1; // Search in the left half
      }
      return -1; // Not found
  }
  ```

### 3. **Graph Algorithms**

Graph algorithms are used to traverse and analyze graphs. Common algorithms include:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: An algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

  **Example**:

  ```csharp
  void DFS(int v, bool[] visited, List<int>[] adj)
  {
      visited[v] = true;
      Console.Write(v + " "); // Process the node

      foreach (var neighbor in adj[v])
      {
          if (!visited[neighbor])
              DFS(neighbor, visited, adj);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: An algorithm that explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

  **Example**:

  ```csharp
  void BFS(int start, bool[] visited, List<int>[] adj)
  {
      Queue<int> queue = new Queue<int>();
      visited[start] = true;
      queue.Enqueue(start);

      while (queue.Count > 0)
      {
          int v = queue.Dequeue();
          Console.Write(v + " "); // Process the node

          foreach (var neighbor in adj[v])
          {
              if (!visited[neighbor])
              {
                  visited[neighbor] = true;
                  queue.Enqueue(neighbor);
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### 4. **Dynamic Programming**

Dynamic programming is an optimization technique that solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations.

- **Example**: Fibonacci sequence calculation using dynamic programming.

```csharp
int Fibonacci(int n)
{
    if (n <= 1)
        return n;

    int[] fib = new int[n + 1];
    fib[0] = 0;
    fib[1] = 1;

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];

    return fib[n];
}
```

### 5. **Recursion**

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.

- **Example**: Factorial calculation using recursion.

```csharp
int Factorial(int n)
{
    if (n <= 1)
        return 1;
    return n * Factorial(n - 1);
}
```

### 6. **Backtracking Algorithms**

Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithm that builds solutions incrementally and abandons them if they do not lead to a valid solution.

- **Example**: Solving the N-Queens problem.

```csharp
bool SolveNQueens(int[,] board, int row, int n)
{
    if (row >= n)
        return true; // All queens are placed

    for (int col = 0; col < n; col++)
    {
        if (IsSafe(board, row, col, n))
        {
            board[row, col] = 1; // Place queen
            if (SolveNQueens(board, row + 1, n))
                return true; // Recur to place the next queen
            board[row, col] = 0; // Backtrack
        }
    }
    return false; // No solution found
}
```
