  - Securing sensitive data using Azure Key Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

- **OWASP Best Practices**:
  - Common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF).
  - Secure coding practices for .NET Core.

---

### **5. Database and Data Handling**

Staff Engineers often oversee data-related decisions.

- **Relational Databases**:

  - Advanced SQL and performance tuning.
  - Indexing and query optimization.
  - Database migrations in EF Core.

- **NoSQL Databases**:

  - MongoDB, CosmosDB, or DynamoDB.
  - When to use NoSQL vs. relational databases.

- **Data Pipelines**:
  - ETL processes and tools.
  - Streaming data with Kafka or Event Hubs.

---

### **6. Performance and Optimization**

You may be asked to identify bottlenecks and optimize systems.

- **Performance Profiling**:

  - Tools like dotTrace, PerfView, and Visual Studio Profiler.

- **Code Optimization**:

  - Reducing memory allocations and garbage collection impact.
  - Benchmarking with BenchmarkDotNet.

- **API Performance**:
  - Compression (e.g., Gzip).
  - Rate limiting and throttling.
  - Load balancing strategies.

---

### **7. Testing and Quality Assurance**

Testing is vital for ensuring robust systems.

- **Unit Testing**:

  - Testing frameworks like xUnit, NUnit.
  - Mocking and dependency injection in tests.

- **Integration Testing**:

  - Testing APIs and database integration.
  - Using tools like Postman or Swagger for API testing.

- **End-to-End Testing**:

  - Automated UI testing with Selenium or Playwright.

- **Test Strategies**:
  - Test Pyramid (unit, integration, end-to-end).
  - CI/CD pipeline integration for automated tests.

---

### **8. Observability and Monitoring**

Demonstrating how you ensure system reliability is critical.

- **Logging**:

  - Centralized logging with Serilog, NLog, or ELK Stack.
  - Structured logging and correlation IDs.

- **Monitoring Tools**:

  - Application Insights, Prometheus, Grafana.
  - Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry or Jaeger.

- **Error Tracking**:
  - Using Sentry, Azure Monitor, or Raygun.
