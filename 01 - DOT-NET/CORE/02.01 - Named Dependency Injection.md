**Named Dependency Injection** allows you to register and resolve multiple implementations of the same interface in .NET Core by associating each implementation with a unique identifier. This approach is useful when you have different versions of a service or when the behavior of the implementation varies based on some context or configuration.

---

### **Why Use Named Dependency Injection?**

1. **Multiple Implementations**: When you have more than one implementation of an interface, and each serves a distinct purpose.
2. **Dynamic Resolution**: To decide at runtime which implementation to use based on a specific condition or parameter.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps implementations focused and makes the service more versatile.

### **How to Implement Named Dependency Injection**

.NET Core’s default DI container does not support named dependencies natively, but you can achieve it using **factories**, **delegates**, or third-party containers like **Autofac**. Here's how you can handle named DI step-by-step:

---

### **Approach 1: Using Factories**

#### **Step 1: Define the Interface**

```csharp
public interface IMessageService
{
    void SendMessage(string message);
}
```

#### **Step 2: Implement the Interface**

```csharp
public class EmailService : IMessageService
{
    public void SendMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Email sent: {message}");
    }
}

public class SmsService : IMessageService
{
    public void SendMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"SMS sent: {message}");
    }
}
```

#### **Step 3: Register Services**

Register both implementations in the DI container, providing them as named dependencies via a factory:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient<EmailService>();
    services.AddTransient<SmsService>();

    services.AddTransient<Func<string, IMessageService>>(provider => key =>
    {
        return key switch
        {
            "email" => provider.GetService<EmailService>(),
            "sms" => provider.GetService<SmsService>(),
            _ => throw new ArgumentException("Invalid service type", nameof(key))
        };
    });
}
```

#### **Step 4: Resolve the Named Service**

Inject the factory (`Func<string, IMessageService>`) to resolve the desired service at runtime:

```csharp
public class NotificationController
{
    private readonly Func<string, IMessageService> _serviceFactory;

    public NotificationController(Func<string, IMessageService> serviceFactory)
    {
        _serviceFactory = serviceFactory;
    }

    public void Notify(string type, string message)
    {
        var service = _serviceFactory(type);
        service.SendMessage(message);
    }
}
```

**Usage**:

```csharp
var controller = new NotificationController(serviceFactory);
controller.Notify("email", "Hello via Email!");
controller.Notify("sms", "Hello via SMS!");
```

---

### **Approach 2: Using a Keyed Service Registry**

You can build a custom dictionary-based service registry to handle named DI.

#### **Step 1: Register Services in a Dictionary**

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    var serviceRegistry = new Dictionary<string, IMessageService>
    {
        { "email", new EmailService() },
        { "sms", new SmsService() }
    };

    services.AddSingleton(serviceRegistry);
}
```

#### **Step 2: Resolve Services by Name**

Inject the dictionary and resolve services dynamically.

```csharp
public class NotificationController
{
    private readonly IDictionary<string, IMessageService> _serviceRegistry;

    public NotificationController(IDictionary<string, IMessageService> serviceRegistry)
    {
        _serviceRegistry = serviceRegistry;
    }

    public void Notify(string type, string message)
    {
        if (_serviceRegistry.TryGetValue(type, out var service))
        {
            service.SendMessage(message);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Invalid service type");
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **Approach 3: Using Autofac (Third-Party DI Container)**

Autofac provides built-in support for named and keyed registrations.

#### **Step 1: Register Services with Names**

```csharp
var builder = new ContainerBuilder();
builder.RegisterType<EmailService>().Keyed<IMessageService>("email");
builder.RegisterType<SmsService>().Keyed<IMessageService>("sms");
var container = builder.Build();
```

#### **Step 2: Resolve Named Services**

```csharp
var emailService = container.ResolveKeyed<IMessageService>("email");
var smsService = container.ResolveKeyed<IMessageService>("sms");
emailService.SendMessage("Hello via Email!");
smsService.SendMessage("Hello via SMS!");
```

### **Best Practices for Named DI**

1. **Use Factories for Simplicity**:

   - For most cases, the factory approach works well with .NET Core’s default DI container.

2. **Avoid Hardcoding Strings**:

   - Use constants or enums instead of hardcoded string keys for better maintainability.

3. **Choose Third-Party Containers When Needed**:

   - For more complex scenarios, consider Autofac or other DI libraries.

4. **Document Named Dependencies**:
   - Clearly document what each named service does to avoid confusion in larger teams.

---

### **Summary**

Named Dependency Injection is a powerful way to handle multiple implementations of the same interface. While .NET Core's DI container does not natively support it, factories or third-party libraries like Autofac make it easy to implement. By using named DI effectively, you can build applications that are modular, maintainable, and dynamic.
