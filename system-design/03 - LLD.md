Low-Level Design (LLD) in software development focuses on detailed implementation specifics of a system or application. It involves translating high-level design into actionable components, such as classes, functions, modules, and data flows, ensuring they meet the system's functional and non-functional requirements.

Here’s a comprehensive explanation of **Low-Level Design (LLD)** concepts:

---

## **1. Core Concepts of Low-Level Design**

### a. **Detailed Component Design**

- LLD breaks down high-level modules into smaller, detailed components.
- Example: In a high-level design, you might define a "User Management" module. LLD specifies classes like `User`, `UserRepository`, and `UserService`.

---

### b. **Object-Oriented Principles**

Key principles in LLD, especially for object-oriented programming (OOP):

1. **Encapsulation**:

   - Data and behavior are bundled together.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     class User {
         private string password;
         public void SetPassword(string password) {
             this.password = Encrypt(password);
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Inheritance**:

   - Enables code reuse by deriving new classes from existing ones.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     class Admin : User {
         public void ResetPassword(User user) { /* logic */ }
     }
     ```

3. **Polymorphism**:

   - Provides multiple implementations of a method (overloading, overriding).
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     interface Notification {
         void Send(string message);
     }
     class EmailNotification : Notification {
         public void Send(string message) { /* Email logic */ }
     }
     ```

4. **Abstraction**:
   - Hides implementation details and provides a simplified interface.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     abstract class PaymentProcessor {
         public abstract void ProcessPayment(decimal amount);
     }
     ```

### c. **Design Patterns**

Reusable solutions to common problems in software design.

1. **Creational Patterns**:

   - **Factory Pattern**: Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic.

     ```csharp
     class NotificationFactory {
         public Notification CreateNotification(string type) {
             if (type == "Email") return new EmailNotification();
             return new SmsNotification();
         }
     }
     ```

   - **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance.
     ```csharp
     public sealed class Logger {
         private static readonly Logger instance = new Logger();
         private Logger() {}
         public static Logger Instance => instance;
     }
     ```

2. **Structural Patterns**:

   - **Adapter Pattern**: Converts an interface into one that a client expects.

     ```csharp
     class LegacyPaymentProcessorAdapter : PaymentProcessor {
         private LegacyProcessor legacyProcessor;
         public void ProcessPayment(decimal amount) {
             legacyProcessor.Process(amount);
         }
     }
     ```

   - **Decorator Pattern**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically.
     ```csharp
     class SecurePaymentProcessor : PaymentProcessor {
         private PaymentProcessor processor;
         public void ProcessPayment(decimal amount) {
             Authenticate();
             processor.ProcessPayment(amount);
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Behavioral Patterns**:

   - **Observer Pattern**: Allows an object to notify others when its state changes.

     ```csharp
     class Subject {
         private List<Observer> observers = new List<Observer>();
         public void Attach(Observer observer) => observers.Add(observer);
         public void Notify() {
             foreach (var observer in observers) observer.Update();
         }
     }
     ```

   - **Strategy Pattern**: Allows a behavior to be selected at runtime.
     ```csharp
     interface PaymentStrategy {
         void Pay(decimal amount);
     }
     class CreditCardPayment : PaymentStrategy { /* logic */ }
     ```

### d. **SOLID Principles**

Five principles to write maintainable, scalable, and robust code:

1. **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:

   - A class should have only one reason to change.
   - Example: Separate `User` class from `NotificationService`.

2. **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:

   - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - Example: Add a new payment type without modifying existing code.

3. **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:

   - Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
   - Example: A derived `Admin` class should work wherever `User` is expected.

4. **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:

   - Interfaces should have specific methods relevant to their use.
   - Example: Avoid large interfaces like `IMultiPurposePrinter` with unused methods.

5. **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
   - Example: Use interfaces for dependency injection.

---

### e. **Data Structures and Algorithms**

- Select appropriate data structures for efficient computation.
- Example:

  - Use **HashSet** for fast lookups.
  - Use **Queue** for FIFO processing in task schedulers.

- Algorithmic considerations:
  - Sorting (e.g., MergeSort for large datasets).
  - Searching (e.g., Binary Search in sorted collections).

---

### f. **Database Design**

- **Normalization**: Avoid data redundancy by structuring data into normalized forms.
- **Indexing**: Improve query performance.
- **Transactions**:
  - Ensure ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

---

### g. **Exception Handling**

Handle errors gracefully to prevent application crashes.

- Use structured exception handling:
  ```csharp
  try {
      // Critical code
  } catch (Exception ex) {
      // Handle exception
  } finally {
      // Cleanup
  }
  ```

---

### 2. **Tools and Practices**

- **Version Control**: Git for collaboration and versioning.
- **Code Reviews**: Peer reviews for code quality.
- **Unit Testing**:

  - Test individual components in isolation using frameworks like NUnit or xUnit.
  - Example: Test a function calculating order totals.

- **Logging**:
  - Use logging libraries (e.g., Serilog, NLog) for debugging and monitoring.
  - Log at appropriate levels: Debug, Info, Error.

---

### 3. **Example: Designing a User Authentication System**

**High-Level Design**:

- Define `Authentication Service`.

**Low-Level Design**:

1. Classes:

   - `User`: Represents user data.
   - `AuthService`: Handles login, logout, and session management.
   - `TokenService`: Issues JWT tokens.

2. Methods:

   - `AuthService.Login(string username, string password)`:
     - Validates credentials and returns a token.
   - `TokenService.GenerateToken(User user)`:
     - Generates JWT.

3. Data Flow:

   - User inputs credentials → AuthService validates → TokenService generates JWT → Response.

4. UML Class Diagram:
   - Create diagrams showing relationships between `User`, `AuthService`, and `TokenService`.
