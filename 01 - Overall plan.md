Here's a 5-day preparation plan tailored to your technologies and the Staff Engineer role:

---

### **Day 1: Review Core Technologies**

#### .NET Core

- Review **API development**: Best practices for RESTful API design, middleware, and dependency injection.
- Study **asynchronous programming** with async/await.
- Explore **performance optimization** techniques, including caching and logging.

#### Angular

- Revise **component lifecycle** and RxJS for reactive programming.
- Review **state management** (e.g., NgRx or services).
- Practice dynamic forms and routing (child routes, lazy loading).

---

### **Day 2: Cloud & Containerization**

#### Docker

- Practice writing **Dockerfiles** and creating multi-stage builds.
- Understand Docker networking and volume management.
- Learn how to optimize images and handle container orchestration basics.

#### OpenShift

- Study **OpenShift architecture**: pods, services, routes, and deployment strategies.
- Understand CI/CD pipelines and integrations with OpenShift.
- Explore monitoring and logging tools available in OpenShift.

---

### **Day 3: System Design**

- Revise fundamentals: **scalability, high availability, consistency vs. availability (CAP theorem)**.
- Practice designing:
  - **Scalable microservices architecture**.
  - A distributed system with fault tolerance.
  - A system for high-frequency banking transactions (e.g., reconciliation, payment gateway).
- Learn trade-offs between **monolithic and microservices architectures**.

---

### **Day 4: Behavioral and Role-Specific Prep**

- Prepare examples for:
  - Leading teams through **technical challenges**.
  - Driving **architecture decisions** in a collaborative way.
  - Handling **conflicts or difficult stakeholders**.
- Revise **code review practices** and mentoring juniors.
- Study case studies or white papers on **banking systems**: security, fraud detection, or compliance.

---

### **Day 5: Mock Interviews and Final Touch**

- Take a mock technical interview focusing on **problem-solving and coding**.
- Practice a **system design interview**.
- Conduct a mock **behavioral interview** to refine communication.
- Finalize a list of **questions for the interviewer**, e.g., about the role, team structure, and expectations.

---

### **Resources to Use**

- **Books**: "System Design Interview" by Alex Xu, "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin.
- **Tools**: Docker Playground, OpenShift Sandbox.
- **Practice Platforms**: LeetCode, Grokking System Design.
