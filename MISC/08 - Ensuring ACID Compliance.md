Ensuring ACID-compliant transactions across multiple systems, such as databases, microservices, or distributed systems, requires patterns and strategies to maintain consistency, durability, and isolation. Since distributed systems often face network latency, partial failures, and concurrency issues, these patterns help achieve reliable data integrity.

### **Patterns for ACID Compliance Across Multiple Systems**

#### **1. Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**

A distributed transaction protocol that ensures all participants in a transaction either commit or roll back changes.

**How It Works:**

1. **Prepare Phase:**
   - The coordinator sends a "prepare" request to all systems.
   - Each system validates the transaction and reserves resources (but doesn't commit yet).
   - Systems reply with "yes" (prepared) or "no" (abort).
2. **Commit Phase:**
   - If all participants reply "yes," the coordinator sends a "commit" request to finalize changes.
   - If any reply is "no," the coordinator sends a "rollback" request.

**Pros:**

- Guarantees atomicity and consistency across systems.

**Cons:**

- Can result in long locks, impacting performance.
- Vulnerable to coordinator failure unless a recovery mechanism is in place.

#### **2. Saga Pattern**

A sequence of local transactions, where each step's success triggers the next. If a failure occurs, compensating actions roll back changes.

**How It Works:**

- Split a global transaction into a series of smaller, independent local transactions.
- Two types of Sagas:
  - **Choreography:** Each service triggers the next service via events.
  - **Orchestration:** A centralized orchestrator coordinates the workflow.

**Example:**  
Booking a trip:

1. Book a flight.
2. Reserve a hotel.
3. Rent a car.

If step 2 fails, step 1 is undone by canceling the flight.

**Pros:**

- Avoids locks and scales better than 2PC.
- Easy to implement with event-driven systems.

**Cons:**

- Requires compensating logic for every operation.
- Does not provide strong isolation (intermediate states may be visible).

#### **3. Eventual Consistency with Idempotent Operations**

Ensures that all systems converge to the same state eventually, even if temporary inconsistencies occur.

**How It Works:**

- Use message queues to propagate changes asynchronously to other systems.
- Ensure operations are idempotent (re-executing the same operation produces the same result).

**Example:**

- A payment system sends a message to an order service to update the order status. If the message is delayed, retries will not duplicate the operation.

**Pros:**

- High performance and fault tolerance.
- Scalable for distributed systems.

**Cons:**

- Temporary inconsistencies may occur.
- Developers must design for eventual consistency explicitly.

#### **4. Distributed Locking**

Ensures that only one system modifies shared resources at a time to maintain consistency.

**How It Works:**

- Use distributed locks, typically implemented with systems like **Redis** or **ZooKeeper**.
- Ensure locks have a timeout to prevent deadlocks.

**Example:**

- When two systems attempt to update a shared record, the lock ensures only one succeeds.

**Pros:**

- Guarantees isolation across systems.

**Cons:**

- May introduce latency due to locking mechanisms.
- Requires robust lock expiration policies.

#### **5. BASE Transactions (For Relaxed ACID Compliance)**

BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) focuses on eventual consistency rather than strict ACID compliance. This approach is useful for large-scale systems where strict ACID properties are challenging.

**How It Works:**

- Use asynchronous operations, retries, and compensations.
- Leverage conflict resolution mechanisms for eventual consistency.

**Example:**

- Social media posts are replicated across regions. Users may temporarily see outdated data but eventually receive the consistent state.

**Pros:**

- High scalability and fault tolerance.
- Better suited for modern distributed systems.

**Cons:**

- May not meet strict consistency requirements.

---

#### **6. Transactional Outbox**

Ensures reliable message delivery in event-driven architectures by storing messages in a database as part of the transaction.

**How It Works:**

1. Store the event in a "message outbox" table within the same transaction as the database operation.
2. A background process reads the outbox and publishes messages to the message broker.

**Example:**

- When an order is placed, the "Order Placed" event is stored in the outbox table along with the order record.

**Pros:**

- Ensures atomicity between the database and message broker.
- Avoids reliance on distributed transactions.

**Cons:**

- Adds complexity to manage the outbox table.

---

#### **7. Idempotent Retry Logic**

Ensure operations can be retried safely without side effects in case of partial failures.

**How It Works:**

- Assign unique identifiers to each transaction.
- Track transaction IDs to avoid duplicate processing.

**Example:**

- Payment systems use transaction IDs to prevent double billing if a retry occurs.

**Pros:**

- Handles transient failures gracefully.

**Cons:**

- Requires additional tracking mechanisms.

---

### **Choosing the Right Pattern**

- **Small, tightly coupled systems:** Two-Phase Commit.
- **Microservices or loosely coupled systems:** Saga Pattern, Eventual Consistency.
- **High-performance requirements:** BASE Transactions or Idempotent Retry Logic.

Each pattern has trade-offs between performance, complexity, and strictness of ACID compliance. The choice depends on the use case, system requirements, and the acceptable level of consistency.
