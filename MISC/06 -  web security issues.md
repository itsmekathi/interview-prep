Web security is critical to protecting applications from threats. Below are some common web security issues, their implications, and mitigation strategies:

---

### **1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

**Description:**

- Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- Can steal cookies, session tokens, or sensitive user data.

**Examples:**

- Injecting `<script>alert('Hacked!');</script>` into input fields.

**Mitigation:**

- Escape user inputs using libraries (e.g., `Html.Encode` in C#).
- Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict resources.
- Sanitize inputs with tools like DOMPurify for client-side rendering.

---

### **2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

**Description:**

- An attacker tricks a user into executing unwanted actions on a trusted site.
- Exploits authenticated sessions.

**Examples:**

- Attacker crafts a malicious URL that triggers a money transfer when a logged-in user clicks it.

**Mitigation:**

- Use anti-CSRF tokens (e.g., `SynchronizerToken` in .NET).
- Implement `SameSite` cookies.
- Require user authentication for sensitive actions.

---

### **3. SQL Injection**

**Description:**

- Attackers inject malicious SQL queries to manipulate the database.
- Can lead to data breaches, schema modification, or deletion.

**Examples:**

- Input: `' OR 1=1 --`, making `SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '' OR 1=1` return all users.

**Mitigation:**

- Use parameterized queries or ORMs (e.g., Entity Framework).
- Avoid constructing SQL queries with string concatenation.
- Apply proper input validation.

---

### **4. Broken Authentication**

**Description:**

- Weak or improperly implemented authentication allows attackers to impersonate users.

**Examples:**

- Predictable session tokens.
- Passwords stored in plaintext.

**Mitigation:**

- Use secure authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth2).
- Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Secure session management (e.g., HTTPOnly cookies, secure flag).

---

### **5. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**

**Description:**

- Attackers manipulate object references (e.g., user IDs) to access unauthorized data.

**Examples:**

- URL: `/user/123`, but an attacker accesses `/user/456` by changing the ID.

**Mitigation:**

- Enforce server-side access control checks.
- Use non-guessable references like UUIDs.

---

### **6. Security Misconfiguration**

**Description:**

- Misconfigured servers, frameworks, or APIs expose vulnerabilities.

**Examples:**

- Leaving debug mode enabled in production.
- Using default credentials.

**Mitigation:**

- Regularly audit and update configurations.
- Follow least privilege principles for access control.
- Disable unnecessary features.

---

### **7. Sensitive Data Exposure**

**Description:**

- Inadequate protection of sensitive information like passwords, credit card data, etc.

**Examples:**

- Transmitting data over HTTP instead of HTTPS.

**Mitigation:**

- Encrypt data at rest (e.g., AES-256) and in transit (TLS/SSL).
- Avoid exposing sensitive data in logs.

---

### **8. Broken Access Control**

**Description:**

- Improperly implemented permissions allow unauthorized actions.

**Examples:**

- Users gaining admin privileges by modifying client-side code.

**Mitigation:**

- Use server-side authorization.
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Conduct regular access control audits.

---

### **9. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**

**Description:**

- Lack of adequate logging and monitoring delays detection of attacks.

**Examples:**

- No alerts for failed login attempts or suspicious activity.

**Mitigation:**

- Log critical events like authentication failures.
- Use monitoring tools to detect anomalies.

---

### **10. Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**

**Description:**

- Attackers overwhelm servers with requests, causing service downtime.

**Examples:**

- Botnets sending massive traffic to a site.

**Mitigation:**

- Use rate-limiting and traffic filtering (e.g., WAFs like Cloudflare).
- Employ load balancers to distribute traffic.
- Use anti-DDoS services (e.g., AWS Shield).
